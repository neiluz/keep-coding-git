<p><em>Git</em> our that are in the repositories<br /> 
Compressed be your <em>commits</em><br /> 
Come to us your <em>log</em><br /> 
In the local as in the <em>remote</em><br /> 
Give us today our <em>pull</em> daily<br /> 
Forgive our <em>conflicts</em><br /> 
As we also forgive those of other geeks<br /> 
Don't let us fall into <em>detached HEAD</em><br /> 
and deliver us from <em>SVN</em><br /> 
<code>git commit --amend</code></p
